Package: org.akraievoy:base
Copyright/Maintenance 2011 Anton Kraievoy akraievoy@gmail.com

General-purpose Java code which hopefully would make life easier for some other developer out there.
The code has been mostly pulled out of my own projects with some minor inclusions/ports.
Inclusions have a reference to another OSS library. All the included librariy code was Apache (v2) licensed.

Let me know if:
 * you think I've missed you or someone else in the copyright notices;
 * you want to re-license this code under any other terms.
